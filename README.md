# javascript-playground
This is supposed to be a my javascript playground, where I will practice my javascript (ES6) code that I found interesting or just for pure learning.

# How?
1. My plan is to make the code run in single js file as possible.
2. All file should be able to run via ``bable-cli`` or ``node --harmony``
